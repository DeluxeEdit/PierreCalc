# Purpose #

Adding new options to Windows Explorer context menu can be done in many ways. One can create new context menus by [manually editing the registry](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/add-any-program-windows-context-menu/) but this option is limited in support (static text, no submenus). If you are technical person, you can also follow [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20449316/how-add-context-menu-item-to-windows-explorer-for-folders) on StackOverflow.

With Shell Extension, you can dynamically create a context menu item (or submenu) that is more relevant to the selected file(s).
Shell extension are dynamic by nature because they are runtime DLL inside Windows Explorer. They can show or hide options based on the selected file's name, size, content, etc.
Shell extensions also have the ability to handle multiple selected files simultaneously.

On the downside, writing shell extensions is complicated, tedious and difficult to debug. 

This is where ShellAnything is useful. It provides a simple xml-based way of adding new dynamic options to Windows Explorer context menu.

ShellAnything is implemented in C++ which, for writing Shell Extension, is a safe programming language compared to C#. See [Writing Shell Extensions with C&#35;](#writing-shell-extensions-with-c) for details.



## Writing Shell Extensions with C&#35;. ##

Writing Shell Extensions with C# is possible but highly discouraged and probably not a good idea.

Many articles already discussed the subject and they all comes to the same conslusion: ***Don't do it.***

For instance, the following articles are good references:
* StackOverflow have discussed the issue rigorously : [StackOverflow - Windows shell extension with C#](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2194572/windows-shell-extension-with-c-sharp/2194638#2194638).
* Raymond Chen, from **The Old New Thing**, says "[Do not write in-process shell extensions in managed code](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20061218-01/?p=28693)" and following the release of version 4 of the .NET Framework (with in-process side-by-side runtimes), "[the answer is still no](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/?p=5163)".
* Microsoft [Guidance for Implementing In-Process Extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/dd758089(v=vs.85)) is discouraging the use of C#.
